## Contributing

To get started, you need to first make changes in the `packages/core` directory.
You can find the code for each component in [packages/core/src/components](./packages/core/src/components).

You need to `cd` into `packages/core` directory and run `npm start`.

After your changes are made, you need to `cd` to the root and then run `npm run build`, so that the wrapper code also gets updated.

Take a look at out [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start contributing!
