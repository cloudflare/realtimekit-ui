<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

> There are separate UI Kit packages for React and Angular because they don't fully support Web Components natively yet. Check out the links to the packages below

> [React UI Kit](https://npmjs.com/package/@dytesdk/react-ui-kit) · [Angular UI Kit](https://npmjs.com/package/@dytesdk/angular-ui-kit)

First, you will need to install the ui-kit along with the [web-core](https://npmjs.com/package/@dytesdk/web-core) package:

```sh
npm i @dytesdk/ui-kit @dytesdk/web-core
```

The `web-core` package is the package which handles all the low level logic required for a meeting by interating with our servers. Use it to create a meeting object, which you can pass along to the UI Kit components.

## Usage

You'll need to initialize a meeting object first.

```js
const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
  roomName: '<room-name>',
  authToken: '<auth-token>',
  defaults: {
    video: true,
    audio: true,
  },
});
```

You can now pass this object to most of the components, like so (with Vanilla JS, HTML):

```html
<!-- Load the component -->
<dyte-meeting id="my-meeting"></dyte-meeting>

<script>
  const init = async () => {
    const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
      authToken: '<auth-token>',
      roomName: '<room-name>',
      defaults: {
        video: true,
        audio: true,
      },
    });

    const meetingEl = document.getElementById('my-meeting');
    meetingEl.meeting = meeting;
  };

  init();
</script>
```

## Contributing

To get started, you need to first make changes in the `packages/core` directory.
You can find the code for each component in [packages/core/src/components](packages/core/src/components).

You need to `cd` into `packages/core` directory and run `npm start`.

After your changes are made, you need to `cd` to the root and then run `npm run build`, so that the wrapper code also gets updated.
